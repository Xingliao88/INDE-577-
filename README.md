# INDE 577 Data Science & Machine Learning
## Description
Welcome to my homework repository for INDE 577 Data Science & Machine Learning, an expansive and comprehensive graduate course taught by Professor Randy Davila. This course offers an in-depth exploration of data science and machine learning, artfully segmented into two principal areas: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. It stands as a complete introduction to the discipline, focusing on key algorithms, data science methodologies, and the entire data processing lifecycle.

## Datasets
I have primarily utilized datasets that are internally available in Python, such as the Wine Quality Dataset, California Housing Dataset, Penguin Data, and Breast Cancer Dataset, etc. Additionally, I have incorporated the Fashion Product Dataset from Kaggle

## Outline for INDE 577 Homework Repository

In this repository, I have compiled the assignments from the INDE 577 Data Science & Machine Learning course. The repository is organized into two main categories reflecting the core areas of the course: Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning.

### Supervised Learning:
- Decision Tree Analysis
- Ensemble Methods
- Gradient Descent
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Network
- Perceptron

### Unsupervised Learning:
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- K-means Clustering
