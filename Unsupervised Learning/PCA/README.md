# Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
## Introduction
PCA is a statistical method that simplifies the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. It does this by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables, the principal components, which are uncorrelated and which each successive component accounts for a decreasing amount of variance.

The main advantage of PCA is dimensionality reduction, which simplifies the dataset, making it easier to visualize and analyze. PCA also helps in noise reduction, compressing the dataset while retaining the most important information. It often improves the performance of algorithms by eliminating redundancy and multicollinearity.

The primary disadvantage of PCA is that the principal components are less interpretable than the original data. By transforming the data into new components, you lose the original feature's meaning. Additionally, PCA can discard important information if variance is equated with importance, which is not always the case.
