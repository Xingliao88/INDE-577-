# K-means Clustering
## Introduction
K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data into K number of clusters. The algorithm assigns each data point to the nearest cluster while keeping the centroids of the clusters as small as possible.

K-means is straightforward to implement and understand. It is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets. It works well when the clusters have a spherical shape.

But determining the right number of clusters (K) is not straightforward and often requires domain knowledge or additional methods such as the elbow method. The final clusters can vary based on the initial choice of centroids.
## Data
The Wine Quality dataset is a popular resource for machine learning and statistical modeling, focusing on the chemical properties of wine and how they relate to wine quality.
