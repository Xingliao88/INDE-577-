# Unsupervised Learning Section
## Description
In the Unsupervised Learning section, I delve into the exploration and analysis of patterns within datasets without preassigned labels. The key steps in this process included:

- **Data Preparation:** Similar to supervised learning, datasets were preprocessed for cleanliness and optimal structure. However, the focus here was more on discovering natural groupings and patterns.

- **Algorithm Implementation:** This section involved the application of unsupervised learning algorithms like clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. The aim was to uncover hidden structures and relationships in the data.

- **Result Analysis:** The outcomes of these algorithms were thoroughly analyzed to interpret the underlying patterns and to extract meaningful insights from the datasets.

## Datasets
The following dataset was utilized to apply and evaluate various algorithms:
- **Wine Quality Dataset** 


## Outline for Supervised Learning:
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**:Implementing PCA for dimensionality reduction and data interpretation
- **K-means Clustering**: Application of K-means algorithm for partitioning data into distinct clusters
