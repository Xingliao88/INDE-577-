# Ensemble Methods
## Introduction
Ensemble methods involve combining multiple machine learning models to improve the overall performance of a predictive model. The primary principle is that a group of weak learners can come together to form a strong learner, thereby increasing the accuracy and robustness of predictions.

By averaging the predictions of multiple models, ensemble methods can smooth out individual errors and prevent overfitting to the training data. They are more stable and less likely to be influenced by noise in the data, due to the aggregation of diverse perspectives from multiple models.

However, Implementing and maintaining ensemble models can be more complex than single models, as they involve orchestrating multiple algorithms.They typically require more computational resources and time to train because multiple models need to be trained instead of one.
## Data
The Penguin dataset is a popular dataset for teaching data science and machine learning concepts. It includes data on three different species of penguins from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Researchers use this dataset for various tasks like classification.
