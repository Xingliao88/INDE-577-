# Gradient Descent
## Introduction
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving towards the minimum value of the function. It is commonly used in machine learning to find the optimal parameters for a model that reduce the cost function, often represented by the mean squared error or another loss function.

Gradient Descent is lauded for its simplicity and efficiency, particularly when dealing with large datasets. It scales well with the number of features and is versatile across a myriad of models and problems. Since it's an iterative approach, it can adapt to the complexity of the function being minimized, providing a flexible way to achieve optimization with each step informed by the gradient of the cost function.

Despite its advantages, the choice of the learning rate is critical - too large may cause overshooting of the minimum, while too small can lead to a painfully slow convergence. It is also prone to getting trapped in local minima, failing to find the global minimum for non-convex functions. Additionally, the starting point can significantly influence the outcome, sometimes leading to different solutions from different initializations.
