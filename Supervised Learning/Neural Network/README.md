# Neural Network
## Introduction
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In essence, it is a system of interconnected neurons that can compute complex patterns.

Neural networks can model highly complex, non-linear relationships that other algorithms cannot easily model. They are versatile and can be applied to a wide variety of tasks, such as image and speech recognition, and natural language processing. Once trained, they can be very fast and efficient in inferencing.

Neural networks can be computationally costly to train, often requiring large datasets to perform well, , and they are susceptible to overfitting without proper regularization.
## Data
The Penguin dataset is a collection of data used for biological study and statistical analysis, which includes measurements from three different species of penguins found on several islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The data typically features variables like species type, island, bill dimensions, flipper length, body mass, and sex.
