# Perceptron
## Introduction
The Perceptron is a fundamental component in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It was developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 as a type of artificial neuron. Essentially, a perceptron is a simple algorithm designed for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This means it can decide whether an input, represented by a set of numerical features, belongs to one class or another. Its simplicity makes it a stepping stone to understanding more complex neural networks.

One of the main advantages of perceptrons is their simplicity and ease of implementation, making them suitable for problems with linearly separable data. They are fast and efficient in terms of computational resources. 

However, perceptrons have significant limitations. The most notable is their inability to solve problems that are not linearly separable, such as the XOR problem. This limitation led to the development of more advanced neural network models capable of handling more complex datasets.
## Data
The Breast Cancer dataset, commonly used in predictive modeling, comprises features computed from digitized images of breast mass tissue. This dataset is instrumental in developing models to classify tumors into malignant or benign categories, aiding in the diagnosis and understanding of breast cancer.  It serves as a benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used to demonstrate classification algorithms' effectiveness.
