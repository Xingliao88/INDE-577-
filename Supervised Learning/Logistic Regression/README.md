# Logistic Regression
## Introduction
Logistic regression is a predictive analysis technique used for classification problems. It models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. Unlike linear regression, which outputs continuous values, logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value, which can then be mapped to two or more discrete classes. 

Logistic regression is specifically designed for binary outcome prediction, making it ideal for yes/no, true/false types of problems. It not only classifies outcomes but also provides the probabilities of the respective classes, which can be useful for decision-making. Logistic regression can handle nonlinear effects in data, unlike linear regression.

Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the logit of the outcome, which might not always be the case. In cases of highly imbalanced datasets, logistic regression might be biased towards the majority class. In cases with a large number of features, logistic regression can overfit unless regularization techniques are applied.

## Data
The Breast Cancer dataset, commonly used in predictive modeling, comprises features computed from digitized images of breast mass tissue.  This dataset is instrumental in developing models to classify tumors into malignant or benign categories, aiding in the diagnosis and understanding of breast cancer. It serves as a benchmark for many classification algorithms in the field of machine learning and data science.
