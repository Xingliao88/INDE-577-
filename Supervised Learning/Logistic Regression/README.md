# Logistic Regression
## Introduction
Logistic regression is a predictive analysis technique used for classification problems. It models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. Unlike linear regression, which outputs continuous values, logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value, which can then be mapped to two or more discrete classes. 

## Data
The Breast Cancer dataset, commonly used in predictive modeling, comprises features computed from digitized images of breast mass tissue.  This dataset is instrumental in developing models to classify tumors into malignant or benign categories, aiding in the diagnosis and understanding of breast cancer. It serves as a benchmark for many classification algorithms in the field of machine learning and data science.
