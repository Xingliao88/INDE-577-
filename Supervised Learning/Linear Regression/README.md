# Linear Regression
## Introduction
Linear regression is a statistical method used for predictive analysis. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. 

Linear regression models are simple to understand and interpret, making them ideal for situations where the relationship between variables needs to be clearly explained. These models are computationally efficient, requiring relatively simple calculations, which is beneficial for large datasets. Linear regression serves as a foundation for understanding more complex models, making it a good starting point for learning statistical modeling.

However, linear regression models are sensitive to outliers. Outliers can significantly affect the regression line and lead to poor model performance.  It assumes that the errors of the response variables are independent, which might not always be true, especially in time series data. Linear models can underfit complex datasets where the relationship between variables is not linear.

## Data
The California Housing dataset is a renowned dataset in machine learning and statistics, commonly used to demonstrate regression analysis. It features a collection of data from the 1990 California census and includes information such as housing prices, number of bedrooms, population per household, and geographic location.
