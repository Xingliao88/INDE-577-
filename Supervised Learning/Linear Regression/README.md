# Linear Regression
## Introduction
Linear regression is a statistical method used for predictive analysis. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. 

## Data
The California Housing dataset is a renowned dataset in machine learning and statistics, commonly used to demonstrate regression analysis. It features a collection of data from the 1990 California census and includes information such as housing prices, number of bedrooms, population per household, and geographic location.
